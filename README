The Diff Visualizer
====================
Author: Mikael Roos

The Diff Visualizer generates visual representations of multiple consecutive diffs. Uses canvas. Does not currently work on IE.
Simply generates a positive bar for number of added lines and a negative bar for number of removed lines. Also takes a label for each diff.
